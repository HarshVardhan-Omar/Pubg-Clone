                |The developer explains: "This Nordic-style map measures 2km Ã— 2km, with 52 players and 15 minute match times, making for a faster and more exciting experience!
                |"Livik is still in its BETA stage, and we will continue to adjust and improve it for the best visual and gaming experience."

                |There are two exclusive new weapons for the Livik map in PUBG Mobile update 0.19.0, as well as a huge new vehicle to enjoy.
                |Map-exclusive SMG: P90
                |Map-exclusive marksman rifle: Mk 12
                |Map-exclusive vehicle: Monster Truck
                |There will also be an experimental Livik super firearm training event for the map, "coming soon".
                |"When the event starts, Experimental Trial Weapon Crates containing a special weapon will appear on Livik. Special weapons look similar to normal weapons, but there are differences in the names, icons, etc. Finishes can be used normally on both types.
                |"Experimental Trial Weapons have slightly better stats than normal weapons. You can view your firing and hit stats with your Experimental Trial Weapon after leaving combat."
